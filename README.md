# AIDevcieBot
AI based Device Bot to manage IIoT and IoT Devices. Conversation UI with Face recognition and vision.

> Started as a hobby project to create a one bot to control multiple device scenario. For Example there are multiple devices in home, office, hospitals, factories and how to connect to each and give them control and also read data from the device. The project was created in 2016. Did also implement few cognitive services integration like face, computer vision and sentiment. The bot also uses LUIS. Bot also can connect to devices like motors, control systems or iot edge devices to read data. Bot show cases the integration between how IoT and AI. Yes i only integrated with coginitive AI piece.

> The project was just my imagination.
